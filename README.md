# Project 5: Quotes on Dev website

This is a WordPress theme for the Quotes on Dev website, which is created combining JavaScript and WordPress together. The website is functioning using the WordPress REST API.

Quotes on Dev is a responsive website optimized for 3 screen sizes: mobile, tablet (620px) and desktop (1080px).

## Key points of JS:

* Fetch a random quote on the front page of the website using the WordPress REST API. I used the AJAX method "GET".
* Change the quote on the front page of the website when the button *Show Me Another!* is clicked and update the URL. I used the History API.
* Set a submission form for a registered user to submit a new quote. I used the AJAX method "POST".

## Key points of WordPress:

* A custom Quotes on Dev theme based on the starter theme from the Underscore.
* A default *Posts* page with no comments form. 
* Two custom pages for the *Archives* and the *Submit a Quote* page.
